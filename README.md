# AdmitAssist

**AdmitAssist** is a Django-based web application designed to help students assess their chances of gaining admission to their desired Masterâ€™s programs. By entering their academic details, users can receive a percentage likelihood of acceptance based on various machine learning and deep learning models.

## Features

- **Predictive Admission Analysis:** Users can input their academic details and receive a percentage chance of admission.
- **Multiple Model Evaluations:** The app uses various machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, such as Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and ANN, to predict outcomes.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The frontend is designed for ease of use, allowing students to interact with the application seamlessly.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Python, Django
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- **Database:** MySQL

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)
